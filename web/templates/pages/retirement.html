<h1>Planning for Retirement</h1>

<div>
	<p>You can never start planning for retirement too soon. </p>
	<p>Save early, save often</p>

	<h2>Ways to Save</h2>

	<div id="401k">
		<h3>401k</h3>
		<p data-bind="visible: basic401kVisible">A 401(k) is typically offered by companies as a retirement savings option. A portion of your pre-tax salary each month will be deposited into a retirement account each month, and the company will typically match your investment. 401(k)s are very safe and reliable ways to save for retirement, especially because all deposits into a 401(k) account are tax deductible. <br/><br/>

		<h3>IRAs</h3>
		<div data-bind="visible: basicIraVisible">
			<p>An IRA, or Individual Retirement Account, is very similar to a 401(k) in that they provide a tax-advantaged approach to saving for retirement. An IRA, however, provides a wider range of investment opportunities than a 401(k), giving the potential for greater returns.<br/><br/>

			<div data-bind="visible: moreIraVisible">
				<h4>Traditional IRA</h4>
				<p>In a Traditional IRA, any contributions are tax-deductible, and the funds will grow tax-deferred until withdrawl. Because most retirees are in a lower tax bracket than they were before retirement, the withdrawls will be taxed at a lower rate than they would have been when deposited.</p>

				<h4>Roth IRA</h4>
				<p>In a Roth IRA, contributions are made post-tax, but the funds will grow tax-free, and will have tax-free withdrawls.</p>

				<h4>Rollover IRA</h4>
				<p>In a Rollover IRA, money is "rolled over" from another retirement plan. Rollovers include moving assets from an employer-sponsored plan, such as a 401(k)</p>
